            Thank you for visiting the portfolio homepage of Mike Gelber.
            Michael is currently a tri-professional man. He's a Product
            Specialist II at AppNexus, a Student at Colombia Universities
            Engineering Bootcamp and he's the Bass Guitarist in Take Your Shoes
            Off. <br /><br />Mike isn't just your ordinary guy. He's done a lot
            of interesting things... this includes everything from breeding
            ducks, to working on a dairy farm to teaching classes on advanced
            financial modeling (which is an art not a science). <br />
            <br />
            As this course continues, Mike will continue to grow and expand this
            portfolio. So, stay posted and keep your eyes peeled!
